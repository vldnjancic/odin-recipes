    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>24 crisp Savoiardi (ladyfinger) cookies</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons confectioner's sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>8 ounces mascarpone cheese, cold</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coffee liqueur, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups white chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place ladyfingers into the bowl of a food processor and pulse
            until finely ground. Add in powdered sugar, espresso powder, and
            salt and pulse several times until combined. Add in mascarpone,
            coffee liqueur, and vanilla and pulse until mixture is
            thoroughly combined and comes together in a thick dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop out 1 tablespoon
            dough and roll it into a ball. Place on the baking sheet. Repeat
            with remaining dough. Place the pan into the freezer until dough
            balls are chilled through, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place white chocolate chips and vegetable oil into a
            microwave-safe bowl. Heat at 50% power in 30-second intervals,
            stirring after each interval, until melted, about 1 to 1 1/2
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove dough balls from the freezer. Carefully dip a dough ball
            into melted white chocolate until thoroughly coated. Allow some
            excess chocolate to drip off; then carefully place it back onto
            the lined baking sheet. Repeat this process with remaining
            truffles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place truffles into the refrigerator until chocolate is set,
            about 10 minutes. Dust truffles with cocoa powder just before
            serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
