        <h1>Puff Pastry Chicken and Leek Casserole</h1>
        <p>
            Leeks, whose soft, sweet, delicate flavor takes center stage in this
            puff pastry chicken and leek casserole recipe, create a rich
            foundation for tender chicken and savory veggies. Flaky puff pastry
            brings an irresistibly golden crunch that brings it all together.

            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
                9x13-inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chicken, carrots, celery, leek, peas, parsley, bay leaves,
                garlic, shallot, tarragon, salt, basil, and black pepper in a
                large saucepan. Stir in milk until blended; bring to a simmer.
                Cover saucepan; simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat; cool
                slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Strain milk into a bowl; set aside. Separate chicken and
                vegetables into separate bowls. Tear chicken into bite-sized
                chunks when cool enough to handle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter in the same saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour
                until smooth; continue cooking and stirring until mixture
                thickens, turns golden, and becomes a roux. Gradually add
                strained milk, stirring until it becomes a sauce. Stir in heavy
                cream and Dijon mustard, then add chicken and vegetables. Remove
                from heat; cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour chicken mixture into the prepared baking dish. Roll out
                puff pastry; place over casserole, overlapping to completely
                enclose filling. Brush pastry top with beaten egg; make several
                vents in pastry top using a sharp knife.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
