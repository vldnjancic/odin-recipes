        <h1>Peek-A-Boo Beef Wellington</h1>
        <p>
            I'm calling this peek-a-boo-beef-Wellington, because what you see is
            what you get. All the components of a Wellington are cooked to
            perfection separately before assembling, and you get crispier puff
            pastry, mushrooms with a better texture, an exquisite tenderloin,
            and the prettiest stack of wonderful things you have ever seen or
            tasted. A perfect holiday meal for one.
        </p>

            <li>1 tablespoon heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cold butter, cut into small pieces</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon smooth duck pate</li>
            <li>1 (1 tablespoon) slice truffle brie cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sliced chives</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking
                sheet with parchment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove puff pastry from the freezer and allow to thaw on the
                countertop for about 5 minutes. While still partially frozen,
                use a 4-inch round pastry cutter to cut 2 circles of pastry;
                place on the prepared baking sheet. Use a fork to prick the
                dough all over.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Press pastry down
                with a spatula and flip over. Place back in the oven until deep
                golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. Transfer onto a cooling
                rack, and let cool completely before using.
            </li>
            <li>Season steak generously with salt and pepper and set aside.</li>
            <li>
                Add olive oil and 1 1/2 tablespoons clarified butter to a
                skillet set over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and a big pinch
                of salt, and cook, stirring, until mushrooms have given up their
                liquid and have started to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add shallots;
                cook and stir until they soften. sweeten, and turn translucent,
                3 or 4 minutes more. Turn off the heat and add thyme leaves.
                Transfer to a bowl and reserve until needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the skillet back on the stove over medium-high heat, and
                add remaining clarified butter. Once hot, sear steak for 3 to 4
                minutes per side, or until it reaches your desired doneness [120
                to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C) for rare to medium rare].
                Transfer onto a plate, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for
                about 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, for pan sauce, pour sherry wine and vinegar into the
                skillet, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil until
                mixture reduces by half, 30 to 60 seconds. Pour in beef bone
                broth, and season with salt and pepper. Continue to boil until
                reduced to about 1/4 cup liquid, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to
                low; add cream and butter, and stir or swirl the pan until
                emulsified into a smooth sauce. Turn off the heat and season to
                taste with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place rested steak on one piece of puff pastry, and top with 2
                thin slices of pate. Spoon mushroom mixture over, and top with a
                thin slice of truffle brie. Spoon pan sauce over the top,
                garnish with a pinch of chives, and place second piece of puff
                pastry on top. Serve immediately.
