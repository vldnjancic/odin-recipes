    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored cream
      cheese spread and it's wonderful! Drizzle a little extra honey after
      they're grilled and they're perfect!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="unordered">
      <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
      <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="ordered">
      <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the
        grill. Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks.
        Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop
        of the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was. Grill for 2
        to 3 more minutes, or until the filling is warm. Serve immediately.
